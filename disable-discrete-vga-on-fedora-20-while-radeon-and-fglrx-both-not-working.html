  </div>
  <div class="article_text">
    <p>I just migrated to Fedora 20 only out of pure love for its slick UI. When I first installed Fedora 15, I had this annoying VGA cooler that spinned like crazy and consumed a great portion of power that drained my battery pretty fast. I have a Dell, and it has dual graphics cards, one discrete and the other integrated. After a bit of search, I think I solved the problem by installing the <strong>propriety</strong> AMD Catalyst Driver <strong>fglrx</strong> and succeeded using the hybrid graphics cards alternatively. </p>
<p>But this time, Fedora 20 is quite new, and the latest propriety driver is not up to date with the new linux kernels. There are compatibility issues around that I cannot address. But Fedora 20 does ship with the <a href="http://www.x.org/wiki/RadeonFeature/"><strong>open</strong> source radeon drivers</a>. These drivers are written mostly by the community based on specs published by AMD.</p>
<p>You can use the following command to check whether the Fedora installation has detected your discrete VGA card and installed the <strong>radeon</strong> for you automatically.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span>lsmod <span class="p">|</span> grep radeon
    <span class="c"># lsmod - Show the status of modules in Linux Kernel</span>
</pre></div>


<p>By checking the PCI devices that are currently connected,</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>    <span class="c"># list all PCI devices</span>
<span class="nv">$ </span>lspci -v <span class="p">|</span> less
    <span class="c"># search &#39;/VGA&#39;</span>
    <span class="c"># or less verbose</span>
<span class="nv">$lspci</span> <span class="p">|</span> grep -i VGA
</pre></div>


<p>I see two graphics cards turned on, but only the integrated one with the tag <code>[VGA controller]</code> which indicates it currently controls how my computer displays on screen. However the radeon open-source driver doesn't seem to work event it's now turned on. As I don't need two cards, and I don't need extremely fancy graphics, so the integrated Intel graphics card should work for me. And so I opt to turn off the discrete AMD card.</p>
<p>I found a solution on <a href="https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/hybrid_graphics">wiki archlinux</a>, and it elaborates quite well on related topics:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="nv">$ </span><span class="nb">echo </span>OFF &gt; /sys/kernel/debug/vgaswitcheroo/switch
    <span class="c"># turns off the discrete GPU</span>
</pre></div>


<p>Note the <strong>Current Problems</strong> section on the page very well clarifies the issues about intel+ati cards on Linux:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>The Dynamic Switch needs Xorg support for the discrete videocard assigned for rendering to work [1]. So, rendering on the discrete gpu will not work until the Xorg team adds support for it.</p>
<p>This means that with a muxless intel+ati design, you cannot use your discrete card by simply modprobing ( <code>modprobe</code>- Add and remove modules from the Linux Kernel ) the radeon module.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>I added the above script in <code>/etc/rc.d/rc.local</code> to turn off the discrete AMD card on <strong>startup</strong>.</p>
<p>Though I don't quite how the whole thing actually work, but at least I made my VGA cooler shut up when it's not supposed to talk much. And battery life does improve as opposed to that of Fedora 15 I was running with hybrid cards.</p>
<p>p.s. There is a <a href="http://wiki.cchtml.com/index.php/Main_Page">site</a> providing document tips, tricks and problems related to AMD's proprietary Linux driver (a.k.a. fglrx) which might be helpful if you are not using the newest Linux distros.</p>
