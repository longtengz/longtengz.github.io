What's the idea behind virtual memory?

Why is virtual memory useful to be bigger than available physical memory?

Don't have to explicitly manage physical memory. Can be compatible with machines that have different amount of memory. Also security (which is just a side product of VM, other mechanisms like the one in Opal system can provide security too)!

How does address translation work/happen? (Draw translation figure with page table)

memory segmentation vs. memory paging vs. hybrid
